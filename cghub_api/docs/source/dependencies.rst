lxml
-----

The lxml XML toolkit is a Pythonic binding for the C libraries libxml2 and libxslt. It is unique in that it combines the speed and XML feature completeness of these libraries with the simplicity of a native Python API, mostly compatible but superior to the well-known ElementTree API.

Here we also use its alternative API -- `lxml.objectify <http://lxml.de/objectify.html>`__
