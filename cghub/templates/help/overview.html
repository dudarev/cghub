          The CGHub Data Browser enables users to explore the cancer genomics
          data at CGHub.  The application use a familiar <em>shopping
          cart</em> paradigm.  The user browses the available data sets using
          filters and text searches.  Details of individual data sets can be
          examined by clicking on the entries in the resulting list. Some or all
          of the resulting data sets are then added to the <em>cart</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the <em>cart</em>, the user may create a manifest file to pass
          to the <code>gtdownload</code> high-performance transfer client to
          download the data sets.  The user may also download a summary of the
          results in TSV (tab-separated values) format, suitable for import
          into a spreadsheet or download the complete metadata in SRA XML
          format.
        </p>

        <p>
          The CGHub Data Browser makes extensive use of tooltips to assist in
          using the browser.  Most user interface elements and menu items will
          pop-up a description if the mouse hovers over the item for 1/4 of a
          second.  Many of the values in the data list, particularly acronyms
          and abbreviations, also have tooltips to describe their meaning.
        </p>

        <h2> <span id="filters">Filters</span> </h2>
        <p>The primary method of searching for subsets of data is by
          specifying filters in the left panel.  Both the meaning of the
          filters and their values are documented by tooltips displayed when
          hovering over menus.  The results will be the data sets matching the
          intersection of the filters and a text search, as described below.
        </p>

        <h2> <span id="sorting">Sorting</span> </h2>
        <p>
          The browse and cart lists can be sorted on most columns in ascending
          and descending order by clicking on the column header.  The sorting
          functions to group related items together.  Since the sorted is
          implemented in the database using the stored code, the results are
          not necessarily sorted in alpha-numerical order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: sorting is not currently supported on the file size column.
        </p>

        <h2> <span id="text-search">Identifier and Text Search</span> </h2>
        <p>Identifier and full-text search of the metadata is also supported by entering
        text in the <em>Search</em> box that appears on the right side of the menu bar.
        </p>

        <p>The search first attempts and identifier search with the text that was entered,
          checking for one of the following identifiers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>sample barcode</li>
          <li>analysis id</li>
          <li>aliquot id</li>
          <li>sample id</li>
          <li>participant id</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If no hits are returned as an identifier, a full-text search of
        the XML metadata is done. The English text in the metadata is very
        limited. Searches for terms like disease name will produce limited or
        no results. Use the filters whenever possible.</p>

        <p>To search the metadata for a phrase (more than one word separated
        by spaces) enclose the item in quotations (for example: "Illumina
        TruSeq").</p>

        <p>Multiple text search terms can be entered in the Search box by
        separating them with spaces.  Results are provided for only entries
        that meet all the specified search terms.  For example, searching for
        "RNA-Seq Illlumina" will select only entries having references to both
        "RNA-Seq" and "Illumina" in their metadata.</p>
 
        <p>Search results are restricted by the currently applied
        filters.</p>
