        <h1>Batch search</h1>
        <p>The Batch search facility takes a list of identifiers and searches CGHub for all matching datasets.</p>

        <p>The following types of identifiers may be used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Sample barcode</b> - This is a terse, human-readable identifier 
            See the TCGA Wiki for a descriptions the TCGA barcode fields: https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/TCGA/TCGA+Barcode
          <li><b>analysis id</b> - UUID of dataset at CGHub.  This is a stable id
            that uniquely identifies one primary data file, that is a BAM or a
            FASTQ.
          <li><b>aliquot id</b> - UUID of the aliquot that was sequenced. A single
            aliquot maybe have multiple CGHub multiple datasets.
          <li><b>sample id</b> - UUID of the sample that was sequenced. A single
            sample maybe have multiple CGHub multiple datasets.
          <li><b>participant id</b> - UUID of the individual from which the sample
            was obtained. A given patient maybe have multiple CGHub multiple
            datasets.
        </ul>

        <p>Batch search identifiers may be entered by two methods:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In the text input box, one per line
          <li>Uploading a text file that contains one identifier per line
          </ol>

        <p>After submitting, the found datasets and unknown ids are displayed.
        The list of found datasets may have entries removed and then the
        remainder added to the cart.</p>
