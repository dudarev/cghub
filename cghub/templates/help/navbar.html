            This is where you find all of the items you have placed in you cart, and where you can select to download the xml files you have created by placing the selected items in your cart. 
            <li>Help<br>
            This link will take you to the help section where you can find some information on how to use the search box and the cart features. 
            <li>Search Box<br>
            his is where you can do a specific search on the metadata you are looking for. For example, if you know the UUID you are looking for you can do a search for it (i.e. <code>c8df19f9-f6b5-427d-a122-619d3379821b</code> will return one result). Once you have entered your search criteria, press the enter key to initiate the search.
