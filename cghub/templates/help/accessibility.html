        <h1>Accessibility</h1>
        <p>CGHub is committed to making the CGHub data accessible to all
          users. If you are using special accessibility tools to access the
          internet, and encounter problems with CGHub websites, or tools,
          please email <a href="mailto:{{ SUPPORT_EMAIL }}">CGHub
          Support</a> or call: 831-459-5243, and a support specialist will
          assist you.</p>

        <p>Please note that in addition to the web based data browser tool,
          CGHub offers a command line tool called cgquery, bundled with
          the <a href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/software/downloads.html">GeneTorrent</a>
          program, which allows you to query via the command
          line. Additionally, a TSV (tab-separated value) file called
          &quot;Data Manifest File&quot; in tab separated values (TSV) format
          is available to download
          from: <a href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/summary_stats.html">Summary
          Statistics</a> page on
          the <a href="https://cghub.ucsc.edu/">CGHub</a> website.  The
          &quot;Data Manifest&quot; file in TSV format file (updated every 24
          hours) can be used to identify important information related to
          files users may wish to download. Please
          contact <a href="mailto:{{ SUPPORT_EMAIL }}">CGHub Support</a> or
          call: 831-459-5243, if you would like CGHub Support to create a
          file, which contains all of the metadata associated with any
          analysis_id's (UUIDs) in question, please contact
          <a href="mailto:{{ SUPPORT_EMAIL }}">CGHub Support</a> with specific query
          information.</p> 

        <p>While every effort has been made to comply with accessibility
          standards, users may find that the CGHub Data Browser is easier to
          navigate using Firefox, while using a keyboard for navigation. CGHub
          has tested navigability in several browsers, and noted
          that <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a>
          is 100% compatible with two screen readers tested (NVDA and JAWS)
          with keyboard navigation. The accessibility standards do not specify
          which web browsers websites need to conform to, and it would be
          impossible to comply with all web browsers, which is why we have
          provided a link to the latest version of Firefox web browser. Notes
          on other browsers tested: Internet Explorer and Google Chrome have
          noted minor keyboard/screen reader deficiencies which we plan to
          address in later releases of the Data Browser, while Safari and
          Opera seem to be the least compatible with keyboard and screen
          reader devices.</p>

        <p>In addition, we tested Firefox with NVDA and JAWS screen
          readers. Each screen reader has keyboard shortcut commands that
          allow you to navigate a site with the keyboard. Please note these
          differences in the command layouts located in the shortcut links
          listed below.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><a href="http://webaim.org/resources/shortcuts/nvda"> Keyboard
              Shortcuts for NVDA</a>
          <li><a href="http://webaim.org/resources/shortcuts/jaws"> Keyboard
              Shortcuts for JAWS</a></li>
        </ol>

        <p> If you have difficulties, or notice that a web browser and screen
          reader combination could use improvement, please
          email <a href="mailto:{{ SUPPORT_EMAIL }}">CGHub Support</a>, and
          every possible accommodation will be made to comply with your
          browser and screen reader combination.</p>
