            <dt>1:</dt><dd><p>Select any number of filters, from the left side Filters dropdown
		 menus, clicking on "Apply filters" when done to invoke a query. In addition to
		 filter selection, you can type a query string into the Search box on the menu bar
		 as well.  For more details on the Search box please see "Text Search" on the Help:
		 Overview page.
		<b>Note: The search box can be very constraining when used in conjunction with the
		 filters options, so applying both the filters, and the search box, may yield little to no results.</b></p></dd>

            <dt>2:</dt><dd> <p>Select the "check box" to the left of individual results, or select
		 the "check box" to the left of the column headers to select all results displayed
		 on the current page. Click the "Add to cart" button to add these items to
		 your cart, or  click "Add all to cart" to move  all returned results from
		 your query to  your cart.
		<b> Note: Clicking "Add all to cart" may take a bit of
		 time if you choose to add a large number of items to your cart.</b></p></dd>

            <dt>3:</dt><dd><p>You may find it necessary, once you have added items to your cart,
		 to apply new filters and add additional items to your cart. To add more items
		 to your cart simply click on the "Browser" link (in the top menu bar)
		 to return to the main browser view. From the main browser view, apply
		 new filters to invoke a new search, and gather additional items for your
		 cart.
		<b> Note: Items already in your cart will stay in your cart until you remove them.</b></p></dd>

            <dt>4:</dt><dd><p>You have the option to examine the metadata of the items in your cart before creating <code>manifest.xml</code> file.</p></dd>

            <dt>5:</dt><dd><p>You have two options for examining the metadata of items in your
		 cart. By examining the <code>metadata.xml</code> file, you can view all associated
		 metadata related to the items in your cart. In addition, you may also download
		 a TSV file ("summary.tsv")  that can be imported into a spreadsheet to review the
		 files in your cart.
		<b> Note: TSV stands for tab-separated value; most spreadsheet applications will
		 accept this format. However, MS Excel may only accept this file if you rename
		 the extension to comma separated value (CSV). </b></p></dd>

            <dt>6:</dt><dd><p>After examining the metadata, you may choose to remove unwanted
		 items in your cart. To do so select the items to be removed and click on
		 "Remove from cart" or remove all items from your cart at once by clicking on "Clear cart".<p></dd>

            <dt>7:</dt><dd><p>Before compiling a <code>manifest.xml</code> file to pass to <code>gtdownload</code>

            <dt>8:</dt><dd><p>Navigate to the "Cart" page and click on

            <dt>Finish:</dt><dd><p>Invoke <code>gtdownload</code> from the
