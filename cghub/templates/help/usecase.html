        <h3>Use Case Example.</h3><br>
		<ol>
			<li>Navigate to: <a href="/">https://browser.cghub.ucsc.edu/</a><br>
			<li>Pick the filters that you wish to use for your query by utilizing the left side filter bar.<br>
			<li>Apply your filters from the left side filter bar by clicking on "Aplly filters".<br>
			<li>Select the BAM files you wish to download, and add them to your cart. Remember you can continue to peruse the results by clicking the "next" page button and/or changing the number of results displayed per page {10, 25, 50}.<br>
			<li>Once you have the files you are looking for added to your cart, click on the cart in the top navigation bar (which should have the corresponding number of files you selected to add to your cart. E.g. "Cart (72)")<br>
			<li>Once you are on the "Cart" page you can do a final review of your files that will be added to your XML file.<br>
			<li>Once you have verified the files in your cart, click Download Manifest to create a XML file that you can pass to GeneTorrent to download, or click Download metadata to create a XML file that you can examine.<br>
			<li>In this use case I will create a "Download Manifest" XML file that I can then pass to me GeneTorrent client. (please note that GeneTorrent is not yet available for Windows&reg or Mac&reg OS's) Be sure to note where your Manifest Download file is download and the name of the XML file.<br>
			<li>GeneTorrent (GT) command:<br>
                        <br>
                        <code>GeneTorrent -d /path/to/manifest.xml -c /path/to/mykey.pem -p /path/to/save/data -vv</code>
                        <br>
			<br>
            <ul>
                <li>The <code>-d</code> option tells GT to look at this file to determine what to download.
                <li>The <code>-c</code> option tells GT to look at this location for the mykey.pem file.
                <li>The <code>-p</code> opteion tells GT what path to download the BAM files to.
                <li>And the <code>-vv</code> (two v's) is a verbose output to the screen so you can see what GT is doing.</ul>
            </ul>
			<br>All these options can be viewed from the manual (man) pages from GT in the command line ( i.e. <code>man GeneTorrent</code>) or downloaded from CGHub's website found here under "CGHub Documentation":<br>
