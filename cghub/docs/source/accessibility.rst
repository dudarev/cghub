Skip navigation links
---------------------

When user come to page and press tab-button, skip navigation links will be shown at the top of page.
There are two skip navigation links:

    - Skip to main content
    - Skip to primary navigation

By default, main content consist in div.base-container.
But we can specify other point where main content starts by

.. code-block:: html

    <div id="main-nav"></div>

Primary navigation link points to div.navbar.
